# Infusion-Site-Tracking-App
Application for tracking infusion site placement.

The application works by creating points on the diagram. The user inputs the interval when a point will be deleted (expiration), the point will then be deleted after the number of weeks entered. An associated .csv file will be created if one is not in the folder. 

I have added an exe. file of the code. It has been compiled and can be run without Python. All that is required is that .exe file and human_figure.png be in the same folder so it can reference the image in the app.
