# Infusion-Site-Tracking-App
Application for tracking infusion site placement.

The application works by creating points on the diagram. The user inputs the interval when a point will be deleted (expiration), the point will then be deleted after the number of weeks entered. An associated .csv file will be created if one is not in the folder.
